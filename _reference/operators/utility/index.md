# Utility Operators

Advanced operators that change how ROP chains behave.

* [`extractDebugValues`](extractDebugValues/) - 
* [`extractIteration`](extractIteration/) - A field that returns the current iteration, from a downstream
operator.
* [`injectGlobalPosition`](injectGlobalPosition/) - Calls its input using the untransformed global position.
* [`injectObjectId`](injectObjectId/) - Assigns an arbitrary value to the objectId field of an SDF, which can later
be extracted from rendered output.
