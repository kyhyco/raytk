Material operators that are used by renderers to determine the
color of points on the surface of geometry.

These operators are specialized to work with a particular type
of output renderer. So a `sampledPointMat` can only be used with
a `pointMapRender`, and a `phongMat` can only be used with a
`raymarchRender3d`.

These operators are specialized to work in the `MaterialContext`
and may not support being fed through other OPs like filters.

* [`basicMat`](basicMat/) - 
* [`checkerboardMat`](checkerboardMat/) - 
* [`fieldMat`](fieldMat/) - A material that uses a vector field input to determine
the color. Essentially this is a conversion from a
field to a material, with no other features.
* [`phongMat`](phongMat/) - 
* [`sampledPointMat`](sampledPointMat/) -
