An octahedron, with its corners facing the axes.

* `Translate` - shifts the center of the shape.
* `Radius` - the size of the shape.
* `Shape Type` - advanced parameter that chooses between different types of calculations. The `Exact` option provides more accuracy but can produce roughness around the edges.
