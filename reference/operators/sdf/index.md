title: Sdf Operators
---

Signed distances functions which define geometry in 3D space, by calculating
the distance from the surface of the shape at any given point.

These operators are how geometry is defined for raymarching, and they are
often the first operator in a chain that ends with a `raymarchRender3d`.
