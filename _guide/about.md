RayTK is a library of TouchDesigner components that construct raymarching shaders (and other types of shaders) with networks of COMPs using the TouchDesigner network editor.

RayTK consists of a set of operator (ROP) components, and a set of tools for working with them.

The goal of RayTK is to allow artists without a strong knowledge of GLSL to render raymarched scenes, using the familiar elements of the TouchDesigner network editor. Raymarching has been around for a long time, but it is very different from traditional rendering, and it requires a strong knowledge of GLSL and vector math.
 
RayTK is a ground-up rewrite of a previous similar [project](https://github.com/t3kt/raymarching), which was based on Patrik Lechner's [TDRaymarchToolkit](https://github.com/hrtlacek/TDraymarchToolkit), which was based on [hg_sdf](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/) and the work of [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm).
